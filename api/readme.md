# TS GraphQL Example

This small application was created as part of a presentation @ Febracis Coaching

It uses:

- express
- @apollo/server
- @graphql-tools: for schema stitching
- @graphql-codegen: to generate type from graphql schema

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

```typescript
import foobar

// start development server
yarn dev

// generate types
yarn gen
```

## Notes

- As an exercise, this project wasn’t focused on advanced optimizations regarding data storage, processing, accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, etc. There’s still a lot to be done about it.
- As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, feel free to get in touch, here is my email - raphael.lima.coelho@gmail.com
